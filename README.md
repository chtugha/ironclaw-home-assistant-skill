# IronClaw Home Assistant Extension

A WASM tool for [IronClaw](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw) that gives the AI agent full control over a [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) instance via its REST API.

Capabilities include: entity state read/write, service calls, automations, scripts, scenes, MQTT publish, Modbus coil/register writes, Jinja2 template rendering, history, logbook, calendar events, persistent notifications, configuration validation, error logs, and system restart.

---

## Requirements

- Debian 12 (Bookworm) or later — commands below are for Debian/Ubuntu
- IronClaw CLI installed and working
- A running Home Assistant instance reachable from the machine
- A Home Assistant **long-lived access token**

---

## 1. Install Prerequisites

### 1a. Install Rust (if not installed)

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

Verify:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

### 1b. Install IronClaw (if not installed)

Follow the official instructions at https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw.

Typically:

```bash
# Download the latest ironclaw binary for Linux x86_64
curl -L https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw/releases/latest/download/ironclaw-linux-x86_64 \
  -o /usr/local/bin/ironclaw
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ironclaw
ironclaw --version
```

---

## 2. Clone This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ironclaw-home-assistant-skill.git
cd ironclaw-home-assistant-skill
```

---

## 3. Create a Home Assistant Long-Lived Access Token

1. Open your Home Assistant instance in a browser
2. Click your **profile name** in the left sidebar (bottom)
3. Scroll down to **Long-Lived Access Tokens**
4. Click **Create Token**, give it a name (e.g. `ironclaw`), and copy the token

Keep this token ready — you will enter it during installation.

---

## 4. Install the Extension

Run the install script from the repository root:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/install.sh
./scripts/install.sh
```

The script will:

1. Install the tool from source via `ironclaw tool install ./tools-src/ha-tool` — IronClaw builds the WASM for you and auto-registers it in its **Tool Registry** (no skill required for the agent to find and use the tool).
2. Copy the **optional** skill hint to `~/.ironclaw/skills/home-assistant.SKILL.md` — this enhances the agent's context but the tool works without it.
3. Launch `ironclaw tool auth ha-tool` to securely store your HA long-lived access token (never touches the WASM sandbox — IronClaw injects it as a `Bearer` header at the host boundary).

When prompted by `ironclaw tool auth ha-tool`, paste the long-lived access token you created above.

### Expected output

```
==> Installing ha-tool from source (IronClaw will build the WASM)...
Installed successfully:
  Name: ha-tool
  WASM: ~/.ironclaw/tools/ha-tool.wasm
  Size: ~300 KB

==> Installing optional skill file (agent hint — not required)...
  Installed skill: ~/.ironclaw/skills/home-assistant.SKILL.md

==> Configuring Home Assistant access token...
  Home Assistant long-lived access token: ****
  ✓ Saved.
```

---

## 5. Verify the Installation

```bash
ironclaw tool list
```

You should see `ha-tool` in the list. For detailed info:

```bash
ironclaw tool info ha-tool
```

The skill hint (optional) lives at `~/.ironclaw/skills/home-assistant.SKILL.md`. IronClaw's Tool Registry auto-discovers the tool itself — the skill only adds extra context to the agent's system prompt.

---

## 6. Using the Extension from the IronClaw Chat Console

Start the IronClaw chat session:

```bash
ironclaw chat
```

The agent automatically activates the `home-assistant` skill when your message mentions home automation topics (lights, switches, automations, MQTT, Modbus, etc.).

**Every request must include your Home Assistant URL.** Tell the agent once at the start of the session and it will use it for all subsequent calls.

---

## Chat Usage Examples

### First message — tell the agent your HA URL

```
My Home Assistant is at http://192.168.1.100:8123
```

Or provide it inline with your first request:

```
Is my Home Assistant at http://192.168.1.100:8123 online?
```

---

## Complementary: Home Assistant MCP Server

Home Assistant ships an optional [MCP Server integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mcp_server/) that exposes Assist-domain entities over the Model Context Protocol. IronClaw natively supports MCP clients, so you can enable both:

- **`ha-tool` (this extension)** — full REST coverage: state read/write, service calls, automations, scripts, scenes, MQTT, Modbus, templates, history, logbook, calendar, persistent notifications, reloads, error log, restart.
- **HA MCP Server (optional)** — conversational Assist-exposed entities via MCP, useful for natural-language control of the subset of entities you flag as "exposed to Assist".

They are complementary — the REST tool covers administration and maintenance the MCP server doesn't, and the MCP server provides a curated conversational surface that respects HA's Assist exposure settings.

---

## Limitations

- **No real-time event subscription.** WASM tools are request/response only — there is no WebSocket event loop. Use `get_history` and `get_logbook` for time-range queries, or poll `get_state` for near-real-time monitoring.
- **No direct YAML file editing.** To apply YAML changes, edit files via HA's File Editor add-on or SSH, then run the appropriate `reload_*` action. Config Entry reloads (for integrations configured via the UI) are supported via `reload_config_entry`.

---

## Supported ha_url Formats

The `ha_url` parameter must point to a **private or local address**. Public internet IPs are blocked for security.

| Format | Example |
|---|---|
| LAN IP with port | `http://192.168.1.100:8123` |
| mDNS hostname | `http://homeassistant.local:8123` |
| Custom LAN hostname | `http://myha.lan:8123` |
| DuckDNS | `https://myha.duckdns.org` |
| Nabu Casa cloud | `https://XXXXX.ui.nabu.casa` |
| Localhost | `http://localhost:8123` |

---

## Rebuilding After Updates

If you pull new changes, rebuild and reinstall:

```bash
git pull
./scripts/install.sh
```

To build only the WASM without reinstalling:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

---

## Security Notes

- The HA token is stored securely by IronClaw's secret store and never written to disk in plaintext.
- The token is automatically injected as an HTTP `Authorization: Bearer` header by the IronClaw host — it is never visible in tool parameters or chat logs.
- The `ha_url` is validated on every call and restricted to private/local address ranges to prevent token exfiltration.
- To revoke access: delete the token in Home Assistant (Profile → Long-Lived Access Tokens) and run `ironclaw tool auth ha-tool` again with a new token.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`cargo` not found**
Run `source "$HOME/.cargo/env"` or open a new terminal after installing Rust.

**`ironclaw` not found**
Ensure the binary is in your `$PATH`. Check with `which ironclaw`.

**Build fails: `error[E0463]: can't find crate for 'std'`**
The WASM target is missing. Run:
```bash
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
```

**`ironclaw tool auth ha-tool` prompts for token but auth fails**
Ensure IronClaw is configured with a valid API key first (`ironclaw login`).

**HA API returns 401 Unauthorized**
The HA token may be expired or revoked. Create a new one in HA Profile and re-run `ironclaw tool auth ha-tool`.

**HA API returns 400 or 404**
Check that the entity ID, domain, and service name are correct. Use `get_states` or `get_services` to discover exact names.

**`ha_url` rejected as not a private address**
Your HA URL must be a local/private address. Public IPs are blocked. If you use Nabu Casa or DuckDNS, those are allowed.
