# Home Assistant Cron Routines

Prompts you can paste into the IronClaw chat to have the agent create
background cron routines for Home Assistant monitoring. Each routine runs
on its own schedule via IronClaw's Routines engine (see
`capabilities/routines/cron` in the IronClaw docs).

Replace `HA_URL` with your Home Assistant base URL.

## 1. Hourly health check

```
Create a cron routine named "ha-hourly-health" that runs at minute 5 of every
hour. The job should:
1. Call ha-tool get_status ha_url=HA_URL
2. Call ha-tool check_config ha_url=HA_URL
3. Call ha-tool get_notifications ha_url=HA_URL
If any call fails or check_config is not valid or persistent notifications
exist, send a notification with the findings. Otherwise, stay silent.
Never call any write actions without explicit user confirmation.
```

## 2. Daily error-log digest

```
Create a cron routine named "ha-daily-errors" that runs every day at 08:00.
The job should:
1. Call ha-tool get_error_log ha_url=HA_URL
2. Extract only ERROR and WARNING lines from the last 24 hours
3. Write the digest to memory at ha/daily-errors/<date>.md
4. Notify only if there are more than 10 errors or any CRITICAL lines
```

## 3. Weekly integration-update scan

```
Create a cron routine named "ha-weekly-updates" that runs every Monday at 09:00.
The job should:
1. Call ha-tool get_states ha_url=HA_URL domain_filter=update
2. List any update.* entity whose state is "on"
3. For each available update, include attributes.title and
   attributes.latest_version in the report
4. Notify the user with the list and ask whether to proceed (updates must be
   triggered by the user — never auto-apply).
```

## 4. Stuck-automation scan

```
Create a cron routine named "ha-automation-health" that runs every 6 hours.
The job should:
1. Call ha-tool get_states ha_url=HA_URL domain_filter=automation
2. Flag automations with state="unavailable" or last_triggered older than 30 days
3. Write findings to memory at ha/automation-health/<date>.md
4. Notify only if at least one automation is unavailable
```

## 5. Battery-low sweep

```
Create a cron routine named "ha-battery-check" that runs every day at 18:00.
The job should:
1. Call ha-tool get_states ha_url=HA_URL domain_filter=sensor
2. Filter for entities where attributes.device_class=="battery" and
   the numeric state is below 20
3. Notify the user with a list of devices needing batteries
```

## Remediation Discipline

All routines above are **read-only by design**. Proposed fixes are delivered
as chat notifications. The user confirms in chat, and the agent then calls
the appropriate ha-tool write action (`reload_*`, `toggle_automation`,
`call_service`, etc.) in the normal conversation — not from inside the
routine itself.
